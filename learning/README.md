## Tensorflow baseline "Solution template" for challenge `aido1_LF1-v3`

Learning remarks:

For learning you can execute the commands in the Makefile in chronological order. 

For ease of use a Makefile is provided to support all steps in using this template. 


## Create new virtual environment with the dependencies

Create new virtual environment and install all the necessary dependencies. If you intend to use CPU-only for your learning, please change the dependency to tensorflow in `setup.py` from `tensorflow-gpu` to `tensorflow`. 

Type: `make install` 

## Download logs

Search and download the logs(bag files) which are defined in the download_logs.py script.

Type: `make download`

## Preprocessing of logs and save into HDF5 files

Extract topics from bag files, synchronize images with velocities and save the data into HDF5 files.

Type: `make preprocess`

## Train CNN

Train CNN using the extracted images and velocities from the logs.

Type: `make learn` 

## Freeze TensorFlow graph

Freeze TensorFlow graph

Type: `make freeze`

This creates an executable network with minimal size. The saved file will be used for the following submission step.
